An experiment in RISC-V, powered by (to my knowledge) the only easily purchasable RISC-V chip at the moment, the [SiFive FE310-G000.](https://www.crowdsupply.com/sifive/hifive1)
It is an odd and clearly somewhat experimental chip in its own right, but it is plenty good enough for the puposes of this little project.
